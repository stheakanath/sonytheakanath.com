              <li>I'm an optimist, but I've spent enough time inside powerful AI systems to know how badly they can fail. My career has been about steering large institutions toward doing the right thing &mdash; on privacy, on trust, and now on AI safety.</li>
              <li>Director of Integrity at <a href="https://meta.com" target="_blank">Meta</a>. My team is the foundation. We build and run the AI and infrastructure systems that keep WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and Meta AI safe for billions of users and the world's most influential creators.</li>
              <li>Director at <a href="https://ai.meta.com/research/" target="_blank">Meta AI Research (FAIR)</a>. Spent nine months building next-generation AI models &mdash; close enough to watch intelligence emerge. It's where optimism about what AI can do met a clear-eyed view of what happens when it isn't built right.</li>
              <li>Director of Privacy at Meta. Brought in to change how one of the world's most scrutinized companies handles privacy. Wrote the 8 Expectations of Privacy. Built the organization from 10 to 330 people.</li>
