              <li>I look for the good in things &mdash; in people, in technologies, and in how we can use them to help. I've been lucky to work inside some of the largest systems in the world, and that's where I've also seen most clearly where they go wrong.</li>
              <li>Director of Integrity at <a href="https://meta.com" target="_blank">Meta</a>. I build the AI and infrastructure that keeps WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and Meta AI safe for billions of users and some of the world's most influential creators.</li>
              <li>Before that, I spent nine months at <a href="https://ai.meta.com/research/" target="_blank">Facebook AI Research (FAIR)</a> working on next-generation AI models &mdash; figuring out how to release them responsibly and get them into products.</li>
              <li>I started at Meta in privacy, brought in after the FTC 2020 order to build the concept of privacy into how the company operates. Wrote the 8 Expectations of Privacy. Grew the team from 10 to 330 people.</li>
              <li>Before Meta, I co-founded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/09/apple-acquires-asaii/" target="_blank">Asaii</a> as CEO and CTO &mdash; a music analytics company acquired by <a href="https://apple.com" target="_blank">Apple</a> in 2018. Led media recommendations at Apple through 2020.</li>
              <li>Studied Computer Science at <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">UC Berkeley</a>.</li>
