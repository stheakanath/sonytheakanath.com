            <div class = "subtitle">A Memo.</div> </br>
            <span class="paragraph">Thank You.</span>

              I finished writing this reflection a while ago, but I decided to not publish it as I talk about a lot of very personal stuff (sorry, everything Apple secret related is cut out).
              </br></br>
              My short summary is that this was an insanely awesome internship. Sure, it doesn't have the perks of Google or Facebook, but once you learn to look past that fake bait of free food and intern trips, you realize you're working on actual useful stuff that defines the ecosystem of our current world. If you ever get an offer to work here, <b>take it</b> because you won't work on impactful projects anywhere else. 
              </br></br>
              During the entirety of my internship I headed the engineering portion of one of the iOS projects, wrote only shipping code, got selected to present to the executive team for my intern project, and soon in the process of getting a patent for my other project. There's so much more but this is all I can say.
			</br></br>
Can't think any company internship can get better than this. I'm very sure I just got lucky with my team. Nonetheless, thank you for an awesome summer!
