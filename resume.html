		<div class = "heavy">Stanford Mobisocial Lab</div>
<div class = "smallerer_intro">Software Engineering Intern | June 2014 - August 2014</div>
<div class = "internship_details">Worked on enhancing Omlet Chat's App Drawer. Omlet Chat, an app created by Stanford University’s CS research department, is an open system that unifies OEMs & competitors in delivering sharing experience to the user on mobile devices, wearables, and IoTs.</div>

<div class = "smallerer_intro">Astrophysics Research Intern | April 2013 - February 2014</div>
<div class = "internship_details">Worked on a rare dwarf cannibalism event specifically targeting NGC 4449 and NGC 4449B. In this internship I used a novel method to observe galaxies with poor spectra and discovered that dwarf cannibalism events are a feasible option, opening up a new subfield of research. In addition, the method used can now extend resolved star spectroscopy to farther distances, allowing projects observing galaxies above 3.7 Mpc to be possible.</div>
